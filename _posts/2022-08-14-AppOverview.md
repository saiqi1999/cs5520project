This app allows user add notes and save them on cloud, it will automatically sync with cloud if one has logged in.

Once you open the app, there are 2 buttons in the bottom of screen, user could choose to look at his alarms or timers by clicking it.

There are five round buttons on top of screen, from left: Google OAuth(not active since app not published), new user, delete all(with confirm pop up), login, new alarm/timer(depend on your current page)

Click into one of the message title to edit it, if user wants to change their on/off, they could just do it on "main" page.

If user is going to set up a new alarm note, the scheduled time is going to replace the button text in "add new" page.
