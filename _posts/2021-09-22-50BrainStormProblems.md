1 Whole navigation, generate QR code for taxi, bus, uber, train or even airplane (travel management + identified special pass for tickets)

2 Interactive online game, like live streaming, but audience vote for playing a single-player game. Maybe competitive game, dividing audience into several group.

3 There are times when restraunts may have many cooked foods left when they're about to close, use an app to notify customers nearby, and give them a discount for these food.

4 Sometime traffic rules and other rules can vary. Build an application, which takes the user's location as input, get the law concepts and rules useful for him, or he could just search.

5 People like different kind of music, but sometime they just don't want to make little effort too find them. Build an music APP which is linked to timer or alarmclock, which play suggested music every day, "preferred singer", "preferred type", or sometimes new kind of music, could built on Big data analyzing and clustering or machine learning.

6 Don't want to bother ordering on doordash, just set up a weekly meal plan and deliver food to a person automatically. Could also linked to big data analyzing and machine learning.

7 Sometime if you need to find a doctor, lawyer, dentist, or housekeeper. It's kind of hard to gather infomation on their website and compare, inorder to find the right choice. Build up an APP which record those infomation, include basically name, contact, job title and customer comment. For advertising.

8 Traffic jam and heavy traffic happens sometime, a person will need to look at google map to see if there's something wrong on the way to company, then caculate extra time it may take, then his time to go. Build an APP which linked google map data with flexible timed alarm clock to avoid late.

9 Build an APP for furniture Trade-off. Used furniture are good, but they have to be discarded sometimes. Moreover someone have to call a company to take out those "trash", which is a waste. There are people who want cheap furnitures, they can make better use of those furniture. The app may include Furniture deliver service and make money from it, and the pricing.

10 There are some good time to go to specific park or moutain/lake but people may not know. Build an app which include the knowledge they need to travel to those parks and natural scenery, take the location as input because people won't want to travel too far. Could provide some extra information for photographers, hunters, or help to gather people for sightseeing by internet.

got 10 junk, my mind is empty now -_-
