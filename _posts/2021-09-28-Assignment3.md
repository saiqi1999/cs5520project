I wrote an application for note, including functions below:

1. you can add a note fragment to main activity, using an add activity for information input: title, detail and date. title will be shown in main activity

2. you can check the added note by clicking the checkbox, this will change the color.

3. you can edit a piece of note by clicking the title, and change title, detail or date.

4. you can rotate randomly without losing information in note.

5. you can add and edit note in land or portrait status.

6. you can scroll up and down when there are too many notes.

7. upper limit of note number is 7
